Spring Boot application written from scratch using IntelliJ and SpringInitializr:

- JPA (Hibernate) and H2 database
- Thymeleaf
- Unit tests and integration tests (JUnit 5)
- Continuous integration (CircleCI)
- Bootstrap CSS, forms, commands, converters
- Repositories and Services
- Project Lombok

Project was created through the Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru course, by John Thompson, and is still in development phase.<br/>
